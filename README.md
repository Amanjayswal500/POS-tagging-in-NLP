# Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging with NLTK

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on a given sentence using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. POS tagging involves labeling words in a sentence with their corresponding parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

## Features

- Tokenizes a given sentence into words.
- Tags each word with its part-of-speech label.
- Prints the sentence with each word and its POS tag.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pos-tagging-nltk.git
   cd pos-tagging-nltk
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install NLTK using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data:**

   You need to download specific NLTK data files for tokenization and POS tagging. This is done automatically by the script if not already present:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the POS tagging script:**

   Navigate to the directory where the `pos_tagging.py` file is located and execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python pos_tagging.py
   ```

2. **Input Sentence:**

   The script uses a predefined sentence. Modify the `sentence` variable in the `pos_tagging.py` file to test with different sentences.

## Example

### Code

Here is a snippet of the POS tagging script:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag

# Download NLTK data (only need to do this once)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

# Function to perform POS tagging
def pos_tag_sentence(sentence):
    tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
    tagged_tokens = pos_tag(tokens)
    return tagged_tokens

# Example sentence
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Get POS tags
tagged_sentence = pos_tag_sentence(sentence)

# Print the sentence with POS tags
print("Sentence with POS tags:")
for word, tag in tagged_sentence:
    print(f"{word}: {tag}")
```

### Output

For the example sentence `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`, the output will be:

```
Sentence with POS tags:
The: DT
quick: JJ
brown: NN
fox: NN
jumps: VBZ
over: IN
the: DT
lazy: JJ
dog: NN
.: .
```

- **DT**: Determiner
- **JJ**: Adjective
- **NN**: Noun (singular or mass)
- **VBZ**: Verb, 3rd person singular present
- **IN**: Preposition or subordinating conjunction
- **.**: Punctuation mark
